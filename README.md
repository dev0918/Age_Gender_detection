# age & gender detection-using-opencv-with-python


<h3>Introduction</h3>
Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications, such as access control, human-computer interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence
and visual surveillance, etc.

<h5>Gender and Age Detection Python Project- Objective</h5>

To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture using Deep Learning on the Adience dataset.

<h5>Gender and Age Detection – About the Project</h5>

In this Python Project, we will use Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. We will use the models trained by Tal Hassner and Gil Levi. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) (8 nodes in the final softmax layer). It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, we make this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.

The CNN Architecture
The convolutional neural network for this python project has 3 convolutional layers:

Convolutional layer; 96 nodes, kernel size 7
Convolutional layer; 256 nodes, kernel size 5
Convolutional layer; 384 nodes, kernel size 3

 
It has 2 fully connected layers, each with 512 nodes, and a final output layer of softmax type.

To go about the python project, we’ll:

Detect faces
Classify into Male/Female
Classify into one of the 8 age ranges
Put the results on the image and display it
The Dataset
For this python project, we’ll use the Adience dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it here. This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. The images have been collected from Flickr albums and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges (as mentioned above) and is about 1GB in size. The models we will use have been trained on this dataset.

How it works

Let's have an overview how it works in general.


For face detection, we have a .pb file- this is a protobuf file (protocol buffer); it holds the graph definition and the trained weights of the model. We can use this to run the trained model. And while a .pb file holds the protobuf in binary format, one with the .pbtxt extension holds it in text format. These are TensorFlow files. For age and gender, the .prototxt files describe the network configuration and the .caffemodel file defines the internal states of the parameters of the layers.
